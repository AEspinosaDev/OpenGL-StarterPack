# OpenGL-StarterPack (GLSP) 

OpenGL-StarterPack (GLSP) is an open source OpenGL based framework that facilitates and speeds up project creation by offering a thin and flexible abstraction to the basic objects of OpenGL.
 
GLSP is simple and aims for simplicity, adding only a light layer of abstraction to OpenGL. All its classes are designed to be inherited and converted into more complex objects, in case they are used as a base for more serious applications. 

Finally, GLSP comes with the main lightweight libraries used in graphics already included and integrated, to offer the user their functionality from the start.

The philosophy of GLSP is based on inheritance. It provides a simple skeleton that can be easily modified so that the user can quickly achieve their goals.
